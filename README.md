### <a name="avail_pipelines"></a> Available pipelines
Details regarding usage and workflows coming soon.

* genACTTractography  
    * Performs preprocessing to generate anatomically constrained tractography. Assumes Freesurfer tissue segmentation available for ACT processing.

### <a name="disclaimer"></a> Disclaimer
These pipelines are still in the development stages and may undergo major changes. Initially developed for tractography processing as part of the [Khan Lab](http://khanlab.ca) at Western University, London, Canada. Certain assumptions were made as a result (e.g. dwi has been transformed to T1w space) and pipelines may require changes before general / personal use.

### <a name="support"></a> Support and communication
There are plans for implementing the available pipelines within a container for the future.

All bugs, concerns, and requests for features can be requested via the github repository found [here](https://github.com/kaitj/mrtpipelines/issues).
